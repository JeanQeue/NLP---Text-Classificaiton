# NLP---Text-Classificaiton
Training different classification models relying mainly on: A Fully Connected Neural Network, A Recurrent Neural Network, based on LSTM or GRU, A fine-tuned Transformer Architecture from a pretrained model e.g HuggingFace , and compare the different models to find the best approach
